This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. The dataset for this problem is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance\n","\n","\n","We will create a model with the following steps:\n","1. Download and explore the dataset\n","2. Prepare the dataset for training\n","3. Create a linear regression model\n","4. Train the model to fit the data\n","5. Make predictions using the trained model\n","\n","\n","This assignment builds upon the concepts from the first 2 lectures.
